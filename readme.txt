Administrative:
I liked the paragraph 2.2 on page 42 - Programming two-dimensional applications
Angel Edward/Shreiner Dave (2015):Interactive Computer Graphics with WebGL 7th edition, Addison-Wesley

Tutorial: 
to get started I used this tutorial:
https://indigocode.dev/tutorials/webgl
I liked it because it explains the concepts very thouroughly and it is accompanied by a video series, which makes it easy to follow
along as a beginner. However, it only covers very basic concepts and will not be enough for harder tasks than Lab0.
While it is still a nice starting point for noobs, I think it is lacking a wider range of concepts, which could definetely be improved.
