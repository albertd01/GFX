1. claim
I claim to have done all the foundations, the shear view, solid walls, continuous movement, dots to eat and camera centering
I have also implemented ghosts but I have not manged to implement the correct eye behaviour of the ghosts.
Furthermore I implemented having lives and counting points from the advanced gaming aspects
2. tested environments
I developed and tested the application on Windows 10 
I used these Browsers:
Opera version: 105.0.4970.48
Google Chrome version: 120.0.6099.72
3. general remarks
Key 'g' starts the game
Key 'p' pauses the game
Key 'v' enables the shear view
Game is won when all the dots are collected
Game is lost once all the lives have been used up
